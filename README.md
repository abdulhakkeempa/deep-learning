## Deep Learning
This repository contains the materials I have used to learn the basic concepts and fundamentals in Deep Learning for Computer Vision. I have primarly followed the tutorial by freeCodeCamp [<strong>"Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python and TensorFlow"<strong>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA3WxTTPXqQ)

### Awesome materials
